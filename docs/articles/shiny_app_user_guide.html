<p>This vignette assumes that you know how to run the application. If
you do not know, check out <a href="running_app_locally.html">run app
locally</a>.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="home">Home<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#home"></a>
</h2>
<p>Home is the first tab you’ll see when you open the app. It aims to
provide a quick intro to what each tab does, and it contains a cool hex
sticker. You generally won’t spend much time in this tab, but after
updating the package it’s worth checking in to see if anything has
changed.</p>
<p>The home page provides instructions for resetting the app, and
<strong>warns you that doing so will return the app to the state you
first encountered it in</strong>. You can refresh the browser page, or
close the app via the terminal, R session, or R process outlined in ‘run
app locally’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="survey-landscape">Survey Landscape<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#survey-landscape"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the tab where most of the work is done, and the main reason
the app exists. Navigate to the tab by clicking on it in the navigation
bar. You should find four widgets at the top of the screen, a landscape
plot, a data table, and if you scroll down, some controls to filter the
minimum and maximum co-ordinates the landscape will show.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="landscape-plot">Landscape Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#landscape-plot"></a>
</h3>
<p>The landscape plot should display each document in the data the app
has been loaded with as a single point. The original text variable has
been pre-processed, embedded, had the dimensions reduced and then
clustered or topic modelled. This should mean that <strong>each point on
the map should be similar to nearby points</strong>. You can hover over
a point to see a preview of just that point’s text. However, it’s likely
that you want to select multiple points (more on that later) and view in
the Data Table to the right of the landscape plot.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-four-widgets">The four widgets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-four-widgets"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Colour Variable</strong> - <em>select the variable which
should be used to colour each point. Generally this should be something
meaningful to your reserach, and with relatively few possible values,
i.e. topic, or cluster. And not something like ‘date’. Selecting date
will mean the app tries to find a colour for each different value of
date, which will take a long time to run and likely result in
error.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>All Data</strong> - <em>entering a file name and clicking
download will download all of the data in the app to the directory which
you select. If you have used the delete button (explained below) then
downloading all data will mean you get the data frame you first
encountered minus the deleted rows. This is a good way to clean data, as
you’ll often find entire clusters or regions of the map which are
difficult to clean via keywords, but easy using the selection
tool.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter the name of the file you wish to download, it will append .csv
to your file name, so there’s no need to add it yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Search Text</strong> - <em>Entering a regular expression and
clicking the magnifying class will filter the landscape plot for just
the documents which contain the regular expression.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Selected Data</strong> - <em>Clicking the download button
allows you to download only your selections. You might want to use this
when you find a particularly interesting area of the map and would like
to analyse it in R, Excel etc.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter the name of the file you wish to download, it will append .csv
to your file name, so there’s no need to add it yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="selecting-data">Selecting Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selecting-data"></a>
</h4>
<p>Plotly has built in icons which allow you to perform different
actions on plotly plots. If you don’t click any of these, clicking on
the landscape and dragging around will perform ‘lasso selection’, which
allows you to draw custom shapes to select points from. When you’ve
selected some points, you’ll notice the Data Table populate, the label
selection widget appear, and in the bottom right-hand corner of the
landscape plot, the Delete Selections widget.</p>
<p>You can narrow down how much data is available to select from via two
main avenues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>RegeX Filter</strong> - <em>enter a regular expression to
find only documents which include that expression</em>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- --><ul>
<li>
<strong>Clicking Colour Variable Labels</strong> - <em>If you single
click a topic by its name or colour in the top right of the landscape
plot, it will temporarily disappear. If you double click, only that
topic will remain, the others will temporarily disappear. You can double
click again to undo.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="other-plotly-widgets">Other plotly widgets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-plotly-widgets"></a>
</h4>
<p>Hover over each individual widget to get its name/what it does. As a
primer, you can: Download plot as png Rectangle Zoom Pan Box Select
Lasso Select Draw line - can be labelled Draw circle - can be labelled
Draw rectangle - can be labelled Zoom in Zoom out Autoscale Reset
Axes</p>
<p><strong>Beware, these settings are liable to reset when you do
anything which interacts with the plot’s underlying data, e.g. if you
select new data, or delete data.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-table">Data Table<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-table"></a>
</h3>
<p>Without the Data Table updating in response to your actions, the app
would be incredibly difficult to use. This table lets you read and
assess multiple posts at once, without having to rely on hovering over
individual points.</p>
<p>The permalink column has been edited so that you can click to view
each post in its original form, at the website it came from.</p>
<p><strong>Each column can be filtered</strong> according to what data
type it contains. For example, you can filter your topic or cluster
variable to only see posts belong to one or a specified range of topics.
You can filter the text to contain specific words, doing so does not
change the underlying data in the landscape plot, only what is reflected
in the table.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="bigram-network">Bigram Network<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bigram-network"></a>
</h2>
<p>Provided you’ve selected some data, you’ll find a rendered bigram
network when you click on the tab. To keep the app performant, this
network will count the bigrams from up to 5,000 documents; <strong>if
you have selected more than 5,000 documents, your data will be
sampled</strong> before the plot is rendered. For this reason there is
no option o download your plot.</p>
<p>If you wish to create a savable version of the bigram network,
download the selected data, read the data into R, and then use {ParseR}
to render the network.</p>
<p>It is encouraged to download the selected data for any plot you
render in the app, to promote reproducible research!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="distribution-tab">Distribution Tab<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#distribution-tab"></a>
</h2>
<p>This tab is for viewing some helpful summary plots for your currently
selected data. It comes with four plots:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="volume-over-time">Volume over Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#volume-over-time"></a>
</h3>
<p>Shows the count of documents at equal time steps, binned by a given
unit of time. This plot has a draggable element, which allows The
controls should be fairly intuitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Height and Width sliders</strong> <em>allow you to change
the height and width of the plot. Increasing these values will make the
bars bigger, decreasing will do the opposite.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Date Range</strong> <em>allows you to select a start point
and end point in time to view.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unit</strong> <em>allows you to select the time unit,
optional values are: day, week, month, year, quarter.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Smooth</strong> <em>allows you to add a smoothing line to
your data, and once you click this two boxes will appear, one toggles
the standard error segment, the other changes the colour of the
smoothing line.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom Titles</strong> <em>when toggled allows you to add
the graph’s title, subtitle, caption, x &amp; y axes titles.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Download</strong> <em>downloads the plot in its current
dimensions, with titles added</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sentiment-over-time">Sentiment over Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sentiment-over-time"></a>
</h3>
<p>Shows the count of each sentiment category, at equal time steps,
binned by the given time unit. There are no new settings added to those
provided with the Volume over Time chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sentiment-distribution">Sentiment Distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sentiment-distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p>Rather than showing the counts of sentiment over time, this tab shows
the overall sentiment distribution. There are no new settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="token-distribution">Token Distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#token-distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p>This plot counts the top words in your selected data. If your clean
text variable has not had its stop words removed, this will be filled
with uninformative high-frequency words like ‘the’, ‘to’, ‘and’ etc.
It’s recommended to remove stop words in your clean text variable, this
will also impact the bigram network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="compare-groups">Compare Groups<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#compare-groups"></a>
</h2>
<p>This tab provides three plots which aim to help you understand some
of the differences between groups. A grouping variable will usually be
something like ‘topic’ or ‘cluster’, and can be selected for each plot
separately.</p>
<p>Because there may be a high number of groups, and each plot’s
height/width will be affected by this number, the draggable, resize
element is available for each of these plots. If you find the current
plot is overlapping the plot below, drag this element down to give the
current plot more space.</p>
<p>However, in the future the draggable elements may be removed in
favour of auto re-sizing the html container dynamically.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="weighted-log-odds">Weighted log-odds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighted-log-odds"></a>
</h3>
<p>This plot compares groups of selected data. It shows, for each group,
the frequency and weighted log-odds ratio for each term, where a
positive log-odds ratio means the term is more likely to occur in this
group than in the other groups, and vice versa for negative. See the <a href="https://parser.shareldn.com/articles/distinctness_in_text.html" class="external-link">ParseR
Documentation</a> for a more complete explanation of how weighted
log-odds works, or <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/introducing-tidylo/" class="external-link">Julia Silge,
creator of Tidylo’s explanation</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Text Size</strong> <em>controls the text of each word inside
the plot</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Number of Rows</strong> <em>controls how many rows all of
the plots should be printed on. It’s recommended to increase this number
to match the number of unique values in your grouping variable. So if
there are 10 topics, your grouping variable is topic, set this value to
10. However, increasing the width and height can mean fewer rows will
suffice.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>top_n</strong> <em>controls the maximum number of words to
be shown on each group’s plot</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>top_terms_cutoff</strong> <em>controls the number of terms
from which the top_n terms can be selected from. This parameter is
slightly tricky, see below.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When calculating WLOs, it’s important to understand how words in a
corpus tend to be distributed. The distribution tends to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" class="external-link">zipf’s law</a>, this
means we’ll tend to see thousands of words with a frequency of 1/2.</p>
<p>We want our chart to tell us which words are distinctive to each
unique value of the grouping variable, but we don’t want our chart to be
filled with the super low-frequency words which <strong>only</strong>
appear in that grouping variable. If we were only interested in how
likely the top 100 words by frequency, across the entire corpus, are to
appear in each group relative to the others, we can set top_terms_cutoff
= 100.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="group-sentiment">Group Sentiment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#group-sentiment"></a>
</h3>
<p>This chart is similar to the Sentiment Distribution tab, except it
shows a bar for each unique value of our grouping variable. If we have
many unique values in our grouping variable, we’ll have many bars.
Whilst this may seem to be a good thing, we need to be aware of some
default settings and how to change them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chart Type</strong> <em>Choose between Percent and
Volume</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bar Labels Type</strong> <em>Choose between Percent and
Volume</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Chart Type: Percent it’s often helpful to use Bar Labels Type =
“volume” and vice versa for percent. This means you’re less likely to
overstate differences in sentiment when volume is low.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="group-volume-over-time">Group Volume Over Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#group-volume-over-time"></a>
</h3>
<p>Functions similarly to the Volume over Time chart in the Distribution
Tab, but for groups. This plot often benefits from having its container
resized using the draggable element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="labelled-data">Labelled Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#labelled-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>The final tab displays all of the data you have labelled so far. You
can use the Data Table filter and sorting widgets to arrange the table
how you please, and you can download the data using the widget in the
top left.</p>
<p>Enter the name of the file you wish to download, it will append .csv
to your file name, so there’s no need to add it yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="suggested-workflow">Suggested Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#suggested-workflow"></a>
</h2>
<p>Load the version of LandscapeRGolem provided to you by the DS team,
or follow instructions in the <a href="running_app_locally.html">run app
locally</a> vignette to set up the app with new data.</p>
<p>Inspect regions of your conversation, delete spam &amp; irrelevant
areas as/when you find them.</p>
<p>Map out the conversation on your favourite drawing/labelling
software, to ensure you don’t forget where the interesting things you
find are.</p>
<p>When you identify a particularly interesting or specific area, add a
label to it for later use.</p>
