LandscapeR is our R Package for transforming unstructured raw text into a navigable landscape. The package makes use of cutting-edge language models and their dense word embeddings, dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering and/or topic modelling as well as Shiny for an interactive data-exploration & cleaning UI.


## Installation

You can install the development version of LandscapeR using the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
devtools::install_github(repo = "jpcompartir/LandscapeR")
```

## Example Use Case

We can take this table of text:

```{r example}
library(LandscapeR)
library(tidyverse)

ls_example 
```

And transform it into a navigable landscape:

```{r}
ls_example %>% ls_plot_static()
```

We can add colour to a grouping variable to see where our groups sit and how they relate:
```{r}
ls_example %>% 
  mutate(cluster = factor(cluster)) %>%
  ls_plot_group_static(group_var = cluster)
```

We can home in on each group:
```{r}
ls_example %>%
  mutate(cluster = factor(cluster)) %>%
  ls_plot_group_facet(group_var = cluster)
```


An interesting use case which can be used to inform the LandscapeR investigative process when comparing two grouping variables, such as cluster and sentiment, or product and topic etc. is the `ls_plot_variation_matrix()` function:
```{r}
ls_example %>%
  ls_plot_variation_matrix(cluster, sentiment)
```
